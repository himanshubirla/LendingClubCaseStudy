# Business Understanding

A consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers, receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

  - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
  - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc

When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:
  - Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below: 
    - Fully paid
    - Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments
    - Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time
  - Loan rejected

# Business Objective

The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default
